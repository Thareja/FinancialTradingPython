Financial Trading in Python 

I took a great class at Hult International Business School https://www.hult.edu called Financial Trading in Python in the Summer of 2022. Highly recommend it. 

We also took this course on Datacamp https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/financial-trading-in-python

I am sharing my own work and any other subscripts I used to create my own works.
