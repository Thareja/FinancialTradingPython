Financial Trading in Python 

I took a great class at Hult International Business School https://www.hult.edu called Financial Trading in Python in the Summer of 2022. Highly recommend it. 

We also took this course on Datacamp https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/financial-trading-in-python

I am sharing my own work and any other subscripts I used to create my own works.

We downloaed Anaconda from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

How to install on Windows 10: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Ylbn1ikF0

Which we then installed & used Spyder from there. Its like a Jupyter Notebook but different.

We used this package called BT for everything

You may need to install it using "pip install bt" in a console window
